# Summary

## Preface

Recently I learnt git and markdown. This document is a summary of what I learnt. I want to practice markdown language and review what I learnt about git by writing this document. I will keep this document updated when I learn more about git and markdown.

## Git Basic

There are three spaces in local, which is repository, index and workspace. Files can be added from workspace to index, commited from index to repository and checked out from repository to workspace.
- Create a new repository  
`git init`  
`git clone [url]`
- add, remove and rename documents
```
git add [file1] [file2]
git add .
git rm [file1] [file2]
git mv [file-origin] [file-renamed]
```
- commit documents
`git commit -m [message]`
